                <p>We start with plain 8 gauge solid copper wire; this is available from any large box home improvement store and is typically used for grounding. Since it's an easily sourceable material and can typically be bought by the foot a novice smith can purchase small amounts or an instructor can purchase larger amounts for a whole class. Working with copper also introduces students to the concest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_hardening" target="_blank">work hardening</a> as well as the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)">annealing</a> metals. While steel is typically worked hot to avoid work hardening there are times when students may accidentally work a piece that's "too cold" and this introduction in copper can be applied later when we're working with steel. </p>

            <div class="blogPara" id="stepTwo">
                <p>If you're using this project as an introductory exercise there are several basic skills that can be taught and reinforced. Before the piece can be flattened a right angle bend, two curves, and a taper should be placed on the wire. In general, when teaching this project I start the students with basic drawing over the far corner of the anvil; this allows me to also start on basic hammer skills. Once a point has been drawn out we anneal the copper and start on the right angle bend. In a classroom there's typically time for students to make multiple roses which means I can show them a right-angle bend off the back of the anvil as well as a right angle bend using a leg vise; in production I typically resort to the leg vise as it's quicker and gives a sharper bend. Finally the curved parts of the wire are flattened; here you can see the final outcome. One thing to note is that the piece will require frequent annealing; in class students should be continually reminded to anneal their pieces between passes to avoid making the piece too brittle and having several minutes of hard work snap off.</p>

                <p>Once the piece has been pre-shaped and annealed one final time it can be turned into the final rose shape. The shoulder of the anvil is helpful in starting the turning at the base of the flattened out area and a set of vice-grip pliers at the bottom allows for far more ease in turning. In the absence of a set of locking pliers a 90 degree bend can be placed at the bottom to create a "handle". It's important to note that the motion for this should be from the bottom of the piece using either the locking pliers or the handle you've bent into the piece; this will allow for far more uniform turning. A common mistake among learners is to try and wrap the flattened end around the center, which inevedibly leads to a too-tight or lumpy rose shape. Another common mistake is to not anneal the flattened area before attempting to turn it into a rose, which leads to lumpy or angular roses instead of the smooth curve seen in the example to the left. If this happens the rose can be re-annealed, flattened back out, annealed once more, and re-turned. </p>

                <p>This project is a fun live demo as well as a great introdution to basic blacksmithing skills. Not only is a student introduced to the process but, because copper can be worked cold, it gives the student time to reflect and concentrate on proper technique and how the metal is responding to their efforts in a thoughtful, unhurried method. As has previously been mentioned this techn ique also works with steel and students who have completed at least one copper rose now have the cognitive toolkit to apply these steps to a meterial that must be worked hot. In addition, should you with to remain working with nonferrous metals such as copper or brass additional, more advanced techniques such as fold-forming to create organic leaves can be studied and added to the original piece.</p>

                <h1>About the author:</h1>
                <p>Mark Oribello has been blacksmithing since 2008, and teaching adults since 1995. His first opportunity to teach blacksmithing came in 2019 at Prospect Hill Forge in Waltham, MA and he has since expanded to teach additional course at The Steel Yard in Providence, RI. Mark works cross-material and cross-discipline with works blending wood, steel, copper, and brass, and can often be found poking around in welding, woodworking, blacksmithing, and jewlery studios for inspiration.</p>
