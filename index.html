                    <p>Steel is often viewed as a precise, machine-perfect material used for modern buildings and industrial products. But forging allows us to examine the organic side of metals, celebrating the imperfect and vibrant nature of the shapes we create. This project, originally designed by Carl West of <a href="www.prospecthillforge.com" target="_blank">Prospect Hill Forge</a>, starts with copper - a metal that's soft enough to work cold yet which exhibits many of the same behaviors as hot steel.</p>
                    <p>This exercise serves as a prelude to working with hot steel; through working with copper students can practice basic hammer skills and forging techniques without being rushed by steel cooling quickly on a cold anvil. In addition, more advanced techniques such as fold-forming for making realistic leaves and phospher / copper soldering may be used to add details to the piece.</p>

                <div class="cardContent"><p>The tentacle is a crowd-pleaser that combines traditional work on the anvil with a small amount of welding. Starting with a piece of 3/8" steel the stock is tapered to a point, the taper is taken down to 8ths, 16ths, and then finally round. Once the basic shape has been forged the "suckers" are added using a MIG welder and a lot of fussiness. The keychain end is shaped on the anvil but finished and a hole drilled using modern machining methods. Finally, we return to the forge for the final shaping to make it look like a living, moving organic shape.</p></div>

                <div class="cardContent"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldforming" target="_blank">Fold Forming</a> is a technique in which metal is folded, hammered, and unfolded. Invented in the late 1980s by Charles Lewton-Brain it's the first major new technique in metalworking in hundreds of years, and allows for 3-dimentional organic shapes to be created. By folding and then working along one edge of the folded piece the material is stretched along that edge while the rest of the piece retains its original dimensions. I use this technique to create leaves for copper roses and will explore that process in another blog entry, but I wanted to explore the challanges in working with steel as a fellow smith at <a href="www.prospecthillforge.com" target="_blank">Prospect Hill Forge</a> spent a significant amount of time exploring shapes in this material. Some of the specific challanges with steel include not accidentally forge-welding the pieces as you work with the folded pieces and techniques for creating realistic markings across the leaves.</p></div>
