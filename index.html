                <div class="cardContent"><p>The tentacle is a crowd-pleaser that combines traditional work on the anvil with a small amount of welding. Starting with a piece of 3/8" steel the stock is tapered to a point, the taper is taken down to 8ths, 16ths, and then finally round. Once the basic shape has been forged the "suckers" are added using a MIG welder and a lot of fussiness. Finally, we return to the forge for the final shaping to make it look like a living, moving organic shape.</p></div>
